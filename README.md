# You Go Girl Mentorship Network

You Go Girl is a mentorship platform designed to engage school-aged girls with coding challenges.
## Project

1. **About:** <br>This is a **Mentorship Network** specifically made for **elementary school girls** who have **zero** to **some** level of coding experience. The first thing our website does is match a **Mentee** with a **Mentor**. A mentor can be a **student** or a **women** with coding experience, and willing to inspire **young girls** from around the world to join the field of **Computing and Technology.** </br><br>
2. **How it works:** <br>On visiting the website <https//www.yougogrl.com>, you are presented with two **sign-up** options. One for the **Mentor** and one for the **Mentee**. If you are a Mentor, your sign-up sheet includes **questions** about which **proramming languages** you are familiar with, how many **hours** a week can you **commit** to this project, **spoken** language and so on. On the other hand, if you are a **Mentee**, your sign-up sheet includes questions like **coding experience**, **grade** in school, as well as **spoken language**. Once you are done, or if you are returning user, you can just use the **login** and **explore** the site as your own.</br><br>
3. **What we would like to achieve:** <br>With the help of this project we would like to connect **young coders** from the world by **breaking the barriers of language**. By connecting major **English speaking** countries to those countries who are not equally proficient in **English**, or developed in **technology**, we plan on helping those **young girls** find their **passion in coding**.<br>
